\section{Acceleration Experiments}

In this section we conduct empirical studies with our accelerated DPVI algorithms.
For each particular algorithm in the DPVI framework i.e.
DPVI algorithms (D-GFSD-CA, D-Blob-CA, and D-KSDD-CA),
their duplicate/kill variants (D-GFSD-DK, D-Blob-DK,
and D-KSDD-DK), and the fixed-weight ParVI algorithms
(SVGD, GFSD, Blob and KSDD),
we have developed their accelerated variants and verified that they converge faster than their non-accelerated counterpart.
Following the convention of sampling community, 
we conduct empirical studies about acceleration on two synthetic experiments and one real-world application.
